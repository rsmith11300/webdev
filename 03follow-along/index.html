        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What It Says</h2>
        <p>We hold these truths to be <strong>self-evident</strong>, that all men are <em>created equal</em>, that they
            are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
            pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
            just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
            these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
            its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
            to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
            should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that
            mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the
            forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
            same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
            to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the
            patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
            former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
            injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these
            States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

        <h2>Why we are Upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
            <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in
                their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
                attend to them.</li>
