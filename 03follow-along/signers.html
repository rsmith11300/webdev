        <h1>Who were the Signers</h1>
        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <h3>Some of the Most Famous Signers Include:</h3>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>John Hancock</dt>
            <dd>As the President of the Second Continental Congress, Hancock was the first person to sign the Declaration of Independence. His large, prominent signature became iconic, leading to the colloquial use of "John Hancock" as a synonym for a signature. A wealthy merchant, he used his fortune and influence to support the patriot cause and later served as the first governor of Massachusetts.</dd>

            <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
            <dd>Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence and is celebrated for articulating the principles of liberty and equality that shaped the new nation. He was a brilliant scholar, lawyer, and planter who later served as the nation's first Secretary of State, second Vice President, and third President of the United States.</dd>

            <dt>Benjamin Franklin</dt>
            <dd>At 70 years old, Franklin was the oldest signer of the Declaration of Independence. A renowned polymath, inventor, writer, printer, and diplomat, his international fame lent credibility to the American cause. He played a critical role in negotiating the Treaty of Alliance with France in 1778 and the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which officially ended the Revolutionary War.</dd>

            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>A dedicated lawyer, statesman, and political theorist, Adams was a passionate advocate for independence and a key member of the Committee of Five tasked with drafting the Declaration. His writings and intellect were vital to the American Revolution, and he went on to become the first Vice President and the second President of the United States.</dd>

            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>
            <dd>Known as the "Firebrand of the Revolution," Samuel Adams was a leader and agitator in the movement for independence. He was instrumental in organizing resistance to British policies, such as the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts, and played a crucial role in events like the Boston Tea Party. He and John Hancock narrowly escaped arrest by the British in Lexington in April 1775, just before the first shots of the war were fired.</dd>

            <dt>Roger Sherman</dt>
            <dd>Sherman was a lawyer and politician who holds the distinction of being the only person to sign all four of the United States' founding documents: the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the U.S. Constitution. He also served on the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence.</dd>
